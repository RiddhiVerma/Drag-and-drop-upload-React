# Drag-and-drop-upload-React
Using this widget user can upload file by drag and drop or by opening files folder. This is strcitly frontend and there is no backend code or API  involved.

# Create a react app
Create React apps with no build configuration.

* [Creating an App](#creating-an-app) – Please ensure you have node > 5 installed.<br>
Create React App works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.<br>


## Quick Overview

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
```

### Add dependencies
```sh
* npm install react-dropzone
* npm install date picker
* npm add moment
* npm start
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your app.<br>

### Get Started Immediately

You **don’t** need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel.<br>
They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

Just create a project, and you’re good to go.

## Creating an App
**You’ll need to have Node >= 6 on your local development machine** (but it’s not required on the server). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

To create a new app, run a single command:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
```

*([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f))*

It will create a directory called `my-app` inside the current folder.<br>
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:

```
my-app
├── README.md
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── .gitignore
├── public
│   └── favicon.ico
│   └── index.html
│   └── manifest.json
└── src
    └── App.css
    └── App.js
    └── App.test.js
    └── index.css
    └── index.js
    └── logo.svg
    └── registerServiceWorker.js
```

No configuration or complicated folder structures, just the files you need to build your app.<br>
Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:

```sh
cd my-app
```

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

Hooray! your react app is up. 

You can now -  
* drag n' drop or upload a file <br>
* Read the file and view its contents <br>
* Add recipient <br>
* Edit recipient <br>
